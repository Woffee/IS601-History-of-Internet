    <p class="lead">

        Ebay and amazon burst upon the scene in the year 1990. For amazon, their story started as Jeff started his business in a garage in Seattle with his vision to create an online bookstore. His views were, it was impossible for a bookstore to have millions of different books physically somewhere. During that period Pierre Amidyar, just a humble coder, but had an idea of building an online auction site. After Labor Day, 1994, he sat down to create just a simple code in which we can create an ad, we can list up all the similar ads, and bid in similar items of others. At the time of their startup, their pickings were petty like celebrity signed underwear, a toy firetruck, few computer related accessories, antique furniture and a superhero lunchbox.</p><p class="lead">
    By the time of mid 1990s faster, cheaper and more powerful PCs were getting interconnected making network exponentially more useful and powerful</p><p class="lead">
    At first amazon pictured themselves as a giant bookstore. According to Bezos, Profits really were not the primary focus. He added that later that, in gold-rush moments and during the development of web, profits could and should be sacrificed temporarily in favor of rapid growth. That was “Strategy-Bezos”, which can be brought down to 3 simple words, “get big fast”. He thought it was vital as they can give customers certain amount of exposure and satisfaction only if they’re grown to a certain scale.</p><p class="lead">
    Later, three mathematicians of California developed public key cryptography. Public key is used to encrypt rendering secrets of a confidential data, whereas private key which is a combination used by receiver by decrypting the data and produce the original message.</p><p class="lead">
    In spring 1998, Pierre realized that they need an A-list businessperson’s help. Meanwhile even after posting losses of millions of dollars, still the revenue of Amazon doubled . This was a time, with the startup of new businesses in a ganz new economy where rules of gravity and physics cannot anymore hold us down, lead to a business of day traders. They buy stocks from sitting comfortably on their couches.</p><p class="lead">
    Now arises the great question arises that, with such a huge traffic, why didn’t growth of internet come to a halt, and everyone of us might know the same. In 1999, the total number of Internet IPOs were just 250, but Ebay and Amazon stood above of all.</p><p class="lead">
    Jeff’s argument to his fellow ones was not to keep an eye on stock price. And by the end of that year he became the person of the year. Right after 88 years of sinking Titanic, another similar event reappeared. Black Friday. It was the time when NASDAQ astonishingly fell 355 points bringing to it’s painful end by which index may have fallen in a single greatest collapse in the history of stock market. By September 11th, they lost more than 2/3 of their value. Now the empires invested in them like Sun Microsystems, intel were falling apart.</p><p class="lead">
    Later 5 years, this bitterness in .com bubble subsided. Again Amazon took leads with their deep service and relentless focus on their consumers. Against all odds Grove from intel asserted  that, this bubble might have been a good thing. It drew an untold sums of billion of dollars to build internet infrastructure from fiber cable to Amazon customer service Database, And most importantly this all took place just in a short frame of 5 instead of any 15 years. He also added, .com pot a fear and made everyone aware about this web.
