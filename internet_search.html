    <p class="lead">
    It all started with 2 students from Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, Jerry Yang and David Filo. Today they have founded Yahoo! one of the hottest sites on the web. Their big break started when they wanted to heck Stanford’s fantasy basketball league. Those Electronic Engineering students with their access to the web, especially David acquired all the data form earlier night’s game, punched it in, and tried figuring out whether they should bet on, trade or change the players. It was a fantasy for virgin web users, how to find, browse and surf over the stuffs online. Unlike today, it was just compilation of categories and subcategories.</p><p class="lead">
    In 2007 Google and Yahoo! alone generated billions of dollars, but still no one used it for business or commerce. Then the era of advertisement took over and still reluctant to choose their faith, they had their views.</p><p class="lead">
    Their new rival excite, with a tug of war over the sole authority, one after another  launched updates, extensions, emails. But the hard part still persisted, neither of them can locate the desired information from the web. But soon again another resolution came from couple of students in Stanford. A new name Google emerged, meaning 10 to the power of hundred, with their founders as barely socialized junkies college grads, Larry Paige, Surgay Brin. Their basic formula was simple, it started with a notion that web was running continuous popularity contest on existing own content. And  the number of times a webpage linked to a site might be a measure of how useful or relevant it was. It was the core of Google’s interim success. Due to huge traffic, University’s internet falling down. Then they were advised to move off campus. Thought today they have a stock of over 200 billion USDs, their campus based in Silicon Valley, but still investors in the beginning were reluctant.</p><p class="lead">
    Vinod Khosla, venture capitalist, trade guru and cofounder of Sun Microsystem got them on board by offering them one million to sell themselves in a sushi restaurant. So out of frustration they reached a computer science professor, David Cheriton.  But later they moved on to Andy Bechelscheim who funded them 100 of thousands. Still they moved on and accompanied John Doerr and responded of raising a revenue of 10 million in later future. He funded them over$12 million. In order to boost their revenue. they implemented ads in the own Silicon Valley way, simply copying the code from Bill Gross. Later with him, they  improvised with a simple box for query, below unchanged results by google and on the right were the ads.</p><p class="lead">
    On August 19 2004, Google went public listing a share of sales on NASDAQ stock market. 3 Years after that, it boosted more revenue than McDonald, Fedex, Intel, Coca-Cola, IBM, Walmart. Their shares were bought in $100 and sold in $700. As the google responded it’s reach in multiple corners of commerce, their foes have gone longer and more formidable.
