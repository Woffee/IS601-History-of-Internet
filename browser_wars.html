    <p class="lead">
        Being in silicon Valley since 2 decades from now, 2students from University if Illinois, Chicago, Mark and Tryson had a blurred but revolutionary plan. It was about the Web. Tryson along with a few of his colleagues added images, images audio and video to the web. By then without any clear image of what the market was there, just looking at the consumer’s population, it became evident that there is a definite hope. After the start of Mosiac, it reached 1 Million of users in just 2 to 3 months. This start their big break and Jim Clake’s (former professor of stanford). But till now, unlike Jim, Bill Gates was unaware of this groundbreaking phenomenon’s insight.</p><p class="lead">
    Bill was Co-founder and CEO of Microsoft, previously a Harward Dropout having a simple but ambitious dream. A dream of having  a PC at every home, workplace, running Microsoft softwares. It almost came true by the end of year 1993.</p><p class="lead">
    This huge success of Bill was about to be deminished by Clark and Tryson with their new invention Netscape Navigator. Soon after Netscape communication’s success, they caught Bill’s attention.</p><p class="lead">
    After 2 years, due to a bunch of collage dropout engineers at Silicon Valley, internet became a leading phenomenon with Netscape on it’s driver’s seat. But soon happened a beeting between people from Netscape and Microsoft, where Netscape laid an evident fact of their times, nevertheless of winning the price. Microsoft then offered them a million bucks to buy it, with a threat of copying all of it’s info in the hindsight.</p><p class="lead">
    After rejecting this offer, as they knew MS were breaking ethiacal law, Netscape soon started to gain the sucess they planned for and became more arrogant. They however seemed to had forgotten the old saying “not to moon the Giant”.</p><p class="lead">
    At the pearl harbor’s day, Microsoft arranged a press and analyst meeting, with their mischievous intention of mirroring the past. They put their brute force to distroy Netscape with their million dollor invention and a jewel over the web, Internet Explorer. Microsoft stuck with their well known status quo, analysing all the moves of Netscape and imitate them. Later they told Compaq that if they distribute Netscape Navigator, They’ll cancel windows license, and soon Compaq, along with Netscape will be out of service. Unlike Microsoft, with a billion dollor in their bank account, due to their revenue, success started becoming  a challange for Netscape. By 1997 Microsoft triumphed and to award their victory, Gates decided to host a party in San Francisco, Netscape’s own territory.</p><p class="lead">
    With Netscape completely out of picture, Microsoft had a new and unpredictable enemy who knew nothing about computers or web, the US government, looking at Gates as a cyberterrorist. With Gary Rebak on board, MS was sued for excluding people using Netscape products and buring it into grounds. Soon the federal judge issued his final verdict, Gates as guilty. Some analysts reported gates being “torn down” in their company- board meeting. Soon after realising how harsh was the verdict, court overruled by ordering by splitting the brand into 2.</p><p class="lead">
    Gates finally forfeited his position as CEO to Steve Baulmer and leaned into philanthropic acts. Now looking at all these events, it was well evident that even the largest empires can vanish in the blink of an eye.
